title: John Frusciante the Chilli Pepper Plant 1 - Germination
---

<p>
As something to do whilst we are to avoid going outside during the coronavirus outbreak I&rsquo;ve decided
to try growing a chilli plant from seeds.
Apparently it should be quite simple, starting from seeds you must germinate them which should take
7-10 days after which they should be transferred to a pot on a windowsill with the soil kept moist
but not soaked!
Once the first chilli peppers begin to grow the plant should be fed with tomato fertiliser and the
first flowering buds should be &ldquo;pinched out&rdquo; to promote growth of fruit.

Anyway today is the first day of germination - just need to figure out how to add images to this
thing!
